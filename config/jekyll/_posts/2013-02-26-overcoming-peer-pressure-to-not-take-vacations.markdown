#Overcoming Peer Pressure to Not Take Vacations# {: .center}
***
A common problem that employees often face today with their time off is the inability to take a vacation without feeling guilty. This guilt can come from peer pressure, supervisors, or even themselves. Employees need to overcome this fear and take their vacations on the proper schedule without feeling as though they are doing something wrong. Every business knows that staff need their own time to rest, recover, and get ready for a productive year, which is why they track and watch these vacation days appropriately. On the company side of things, many employers need to watch how they treat vacations and consider whether they may add to an atmosphere that makes people nervous to take them.

Using the schedule tracking software that your business provides may make it easier to take a vacation without a guilty conscience. You can pull up a calendar with your supervisor and track the projected attendance of your coworkers. By doing this, you can adjust your time off to correlate with an area on the calendar that attendance is high. Once you've done this, you don't need to feel guilty or as though you're leaving the rest of your office short-staffed.

It's important for every staff member to recognize that their vacation days are not a gift but rather earned with the hours that they work. Vacation is as much a part of what a business owes their staff as their actual salary, and often extra vacation time is used instead of higher salaries. And even though other staff members may cringe when you talk about taking your vacation, they're often all too eager to take theirs.

Businesses need to take care not to cultivate an atmosphere where people feel as though they're being discouraged from taking a vacation. This means not meeting requests for vacation time with reluctance. If the company is tracking their staff's vacations with the right software it should be a trivial matter for them to keep everyone on a good schedule.

In order to ease vacations, businesses can start a transparent system whereby the staff can use areas of the tracking software themselves so that they can see on their own when the best days would be to take a vacation without disrupting the work environment. This will allow staff members to consider their plans without feeling awkward or guilty about it. It is far preferable for a company to have staff members do their scheduling in advance, which will eliminate last-minute distractions.

While vacation is earned, most companies today do not let it accrue past a certain point. Some companies will allow you to cash out your vacation days, but many won't. This means that if you do not appropriately take your vacation days, you may lose them completely. If you truly feel that your fellow staff will be adversely affected by your vacation days, you should sit down with your supervisor and discuss it. There may be a solution that does not involve you missing out on the vacation that you have earned.
