#Tracking Employee Attendance# {: .center}
***
One of the most important things that a business owner needs to know is whether his or her employees are showing up when they're supposed to. However, keeping track of employee attendance is one of the biggest, traditional administrative problems that a business can have. In fact it's often such an issue that entire departments of HR are assigned to cover it and make sure it's followed carefully. Fortunately, thanks to technology, there are now employee time attendance business software solutions that can be used to simplify and streamline this often tiresome administrative chore.

While it is more expensive than just having employees write down their hours worked, time attendance business software is much more effective and reliable. Employers need to have computer terminals where employees can sign in, or they need to provide a method of identification and an electronic timeclock where employees can "punch in" to record their hours worked. Many businesses print ID badges for their employees which they can then swipe through the time clock, recording when they left and when they returned. The result is an automatic record that can be compiled with the push of a button to show exactly when employees worked and on what days.

Using employee tracking software is a no-brainer solution for businesses that want to simplify their attendance records. This software automatically creates records for hours, days, weeks, months and years, making it possible to practically automate attendance and payroll. Only when there are mistakes made do hours need to be inputted manually to reflect when a person actually worked. This reduces the amount of time and effort that goes into payroll, and it means that a smaller department is necessary to handle all of the employee monitoring efforts.

####Implementation#### {: .center}

As with any other advance used by employers, employee tracking software will take some time to get used to. Employees will have to be trained, and there will be some mistakes and problems as everyone gets used to the new way of doing things. However, that said, between free training and easy access it should never be an issue for either employees or employers who need to make sure that hours are correct at the end of the week.
