   <title>Creating the best time off tracking software</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;h1 class='center' id='time_off_tracking_software'&gt;Time off tracking software&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Time off tracking software should be as easy to use and simple as possible. You shouldn&amp;#8217;t have to think about how to submit a time off request. It should be as simple as possible so that you can work on the tasks that need your attention. At Zarlu, I have designed in my opinion the best software for tracking employee time off requests. Each of your employees will receive a subscription to Zarlu when you sign up for an account, and they will be able to use our fully functional calendar, scheduler, and notification system to easily manage their work schedules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='easily_approve_time_off_requests'&gt;Easily approve time off requests&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to developing easy to use software for employees, I focused on developing an intuitive software application for managers and human resources to easily manage employee time off requests. What good is a great employee system if managers and human resources can&amp;#8217;t manage time off requests efficiently? At Zarlu, I thought about what would be best for your account from inception to daily use. The first step was to create a way to setup your account and to group employees by the manager or human resources personnel responsible for approving an employee&amp;#8217;s schedule and calendar changes. To solve this Zarlu provides an easy drag and drop interface for you to enter and group up to 150 employees without having to even change pages! Zarlu&amp;#8217;s setup is incredibly easy. Simply add an employee, which only needs an email and temporary password, and then drag them underneath the employee who will approve or reject their time off requests. It&amp;#8217;s that simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='email_time_off_requests'&gt;Email time off requests&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took simplifying submitting time off requests beyond what other time off tracking software offers by allowing any employee to submit a time off request without even signing into Zarlu. In fact, the staffer does not even have to have a web browser open. To send a time off request, simply send an email to timeoff@mail.zarlu.com with a subject in the MM/DD/YY or MM-DD-YY format and we will add time off request directly to the employee&amp;#8217;s calendar and notify the manager or human resources employee to approve or reject the request. The employee can also add a message in the email&amp;#8217;s message field to give an explanation for the request to the employee from your company who is tracking time off requests. No need to submit a time off request through a website and then send an email to a manager. We do both tasks at once whether you are logged into www.zarlu.com or sending an email from your phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope I have given you a helpful walk through of our time off tracking features.

   <title>Zarlu Employee Calendar and Scheduler Goes Live</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;h1 class='center' id='zarlu_employee_time_off_tracking_software'&gt;Zarlu Employee Time Off Tracking Software&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After months of hard work, I am proud to officially announce the release of Zarlu. I started working on Zarlu after experiencing the frustration of submitting time off requests using traditional employee scheduling software. I found their software to be clunky, dated, and hard to use. Submitting a time off request should be easy. Viewing my schedule for a month, week, or day should be easy. Having a calendar to view my schedule is a requirement for a great personnel scheduler. I decided I could design a web application that made taking time off a better experience for the employee and the business. I wanted something better then what currently exists!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Zarlu, I tried to make a scheduling application that I would want to use on a daily basis. My top three priorities were ease of use, speed, and convenience. For speed, Zarlu was developed using the latest web development techniques to allow pages and information to load as quickly as possible. The majority of Zarlu is rendered on our server &amp;lt; 100ms. Yes, you read that right. I measure your time in milliseconds because that&amp;#8217;s how much I care about devlivering excellent software. Sub 200ms response times are synonomous with &amp;#8220;instant&amp;#8221; in the software industry. With Zarlu, you will never have to wait around staring at a spinner or indefinite progress bar while your computer &amp;#8220;thinks&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my top three priorities for Zarlu, I also mentioned conveience. I have developed a feature that allows you to send a time off request directly from your email account whether on your phone at the top of a ski slope, on your iPad laying in bed while recovering from the flu, or on your notebook at work. No logging in required. Just email us at timeoff@mail.zarlu.com with your work email and we will add your time off request to your calendar and notify your manager to approve or reject your request. That&amp;#8217;s it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, ease of use was my third goal in my trifecta of priorites for developing calendar and scheduler software. I have developed our calendar to use a simple drag and drop interface to make modifying or adding events as simple as possible. Need to extend an event on your calendar? Simply click on it and drag your mouse to the desired time. Zarlu will save the event to your schedule when you let go of the mouse. How easy is that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to hearing your feedback of what Zarlu can do to make scheduling even easier for you! Click on the link below to try Zarlu for yourself if you haven&amp;#8217;t already. Our lowest plan is free to use with no time limit!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>How does Zarlu keep my data safe?</title>
   <link href="YOUR_URL/how-does-zarlu-keep-my-data-safe"/>

   <content type="html">&lt;h1 class='center' id='how_does_zarlu_keep_my_data_safe'&gt;How does Zarlu keep my data safe?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past few years there has been a movement to move data from local computers into the cloud. Cloud Storage provides many benefits: it can be accessed from multiple devices, your data can stay synced between machines, and cloud providers are a backup for your data. One downside to cloud applications is that the user is giving up control of their data and trusting a 3rd party vendor to keep their data safe. As a cloud web application, I designed Zarlu to be worthy of your trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='ssl'&gt;SSL&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look in the url of your web browser. Do you the prefix https:// instead of http://? Zarlu uses SSL on every page of our application to ensure that your activity on Zarlu is encrypted. This is the same encryption used by banks for their web pages. Zarlu uses a 256 bit encryption algorithm to encrypt your data when we send it to you. Many browsers represent this connection with a padlock icon to notify you that your connection is secure. Many websites do not encrypt even their log in form, which means that if you log on to their software from a public place (Starbucks, airport, etc) a hacker can steal your username and password. By using SSL for our forms, we protect you from this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='payment_information'&gt;Payment Information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you decide to use one our wonderful paid plans, Zarlu asks you for your credit card so that we can charge you for the plan you selected. When you fill out the credit card form and hit submit, your credit card information goes directly to our payment provider &lt;a href='http://www.stripe.com' target='_blank'&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt;. Stripe handles all your payment information and then lets us know that your account has been paid for. We then store your last 4 digits of your credit card only so that we can show you which credit card of yours Stipe has on file in case you wish to change cards for a future payment. Your credit card number, security code, expiration month, and expiration year never even touch our servers. We send this information directly to Stripe using the https protocol that encrypts your information when we send it to Stripe. Https is the same protocol used by banks. We don&amp;#8217;t even log your credit card info. Zarlu does this because Stripe handles payment security at the most stringent level possible. They are certified as a PCI Service Provider Level 1 the highest level possible and are used by thousands of applications for their commitment to security. By using Stripe, Zarlu is also PCI compliant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='password'&gt;Password&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you heard of all the recent high profile security breaches where users passwords have been stolen? Many websites store your password simply as plain text, which means in their data if your password is 123456 then their data says your password is 123456. Software can never be perfect, so to protect this we encrypt your password. So if there is ever a security breach on Zarlu, when the attacker looks at your password they will see something like fdlksjfferr98weurwiewf instead of 123456. You many have noticed that our login forms say pass phrase instead of password. We want to encourage you to use a phrase or even a sentence instead of a single word. It is much harder for someone to guess &amp;#8220;My son&amp;#8217;s name is John, and I love going hiking with him!&amp;#8221; then &amp;#8220;password1&amp;#8221;. Keep that trick in mind for other passwords as well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='software'&gt;Software&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zarlu uses several programming languages and frameworks to give you the best scheduling experience. I check for any updates, bug fixes, or patches on a daily basis to ensure that our software is secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id='data_backups'&gt;Data Backups&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on your plan level, we either backup your data on a weekly or daily basis. If something goes wrong on our end (server failure, etc), we have a copy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this page has given you a better understanding of how much we value the security of your information here at Zarlu. If you have any additional concerns feel free to contact us by clicking on the support link. If you have detected any security vulnerability in the Zarlu software, please click on support and let us know! Good deeds are rewarded!&lt;/p&gt;</content>
