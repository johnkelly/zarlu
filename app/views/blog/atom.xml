   <title>When To Take Sick Days</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;h1 class=&#39;center&#39; id=&#39;when_to_take_sick_days&#39;&gt;When to take sick days&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sick days have a complicated relationship with employers and employees alike. It&amp;#8217;s almost impossible to find an employee that will not occasionally call in sick for a personal reason, and there are many staff members that make it a habit. In order to adjust to this, most employers have to accept that sick days will sometimes be used as time off. By tracking their staff&amp;#8217;s attendance with tracking software, managers can avoid letting their staff take advantage of their good faith and make sure that these situations don&amp;#8217;t leave them in a bind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most companies give their staff both paid time off, and sick days. These are usually accrued by the paycheck based on the hours that the employees have worked, so it can be difficult to keep track of which staff members are still owed what hours. Paid time off is usually used as a staff member&amp;#8217;s vacation time. A good schedule tracking software will make it easy for a business to pull up a staff member&amp;#8217;s attendance and see exactly what hours they are due and if they are going in excess of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the staff member&amp;#8217;s side, while it may be easy to claim some free time by pretending to be sick, it isn&amp;#8217;t a good habit to get into. Because nearly every business does track their staff&amp;#8217;s schedule, managers can see if a staff member is establishing a trend of being sick more than they should be. This type of action will shake a manager&amp;#8217;s faith in their staff, and they may begin to ask for medical slips and paperwork before accepting any more sick leave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sick leave is right to take any time a staff member feels that for medical reasons they will be incapable to do their job. This does include any medical procedures that are necessary for their health, their recovery, and any various illnesses that may come up such as the flu. It does not include other personal reasons, such as sleeping in late or being ill from a previous night out on the town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attendance software can be an invaluable way of identifying problem staff or seeing staff that may be having issues that are consistently conflicting with their ability to do their job. Because a business can simply pull up a calendar and see a staff member&amp;#8217;s entire history, it&amp;#8217;s easy to find patterns that are causing problems. And, while staff may not consider this, many managers will notice if the calendar shows that the staff member only seems to call out directly before or after a weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sick days are earned by staff members with the hours that they put into the company, which means that they are truly entitled to these hours when they need them. Any staff member that is truly ill or has medical problems that need to be taken care of should never feel guilty taking a sick day. That said, even though they are earned, they are earned for a specific purpose and need to be used for only that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>The Pros And Cons Of Unlimited Time Off Policies</title>
   <link href="YOUR_URL/pros-and-cons-of-unlimited-time-off-policies"/>
   <updated>2013-02-26T00:00:00-07:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;h1 class=&#39;center&#39; id=&#39;the_pros_and_cons_of_unlimited_time_off_policies&#39;&gt;The Pros And Cons Of Unlimited Time Off Policies&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlimited time off policies have recently started trending as many companies have found it a good way to motivate their employees during the time that they&amp;#8217;re there. There are positives and negatives to this type of policy that need to be considered before a business decides to use it. Since it is such a radical shift from the traditional time off schedule it can be difficult for both employees and companies to adjust to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With an unlimited time off policy, a business does not track their staff&amp;#8217;s vacation days or attendance, but rather let&amp;#8217;s them take their personal time when they choose. This means that the staff no longer have to worry about looking towards the calendar when they want to schedule a vacation, they simply have to tell the company or log something into the tracking software. The company can still, if they choose, mark off some days on the calendar as mandatory for attendance&amp;#8211;for instance, a particular busy season when they make the most sales or have the highest client volume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For companies, this type of policy allows them to forgo tracking attendance and leave everything up to their staff member&amp;#8217;s discretion. Software can still be used to track their staff&amp;#8217;s working hours and, if necessary, billable time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While some companies may believe that their staff would take advantage of the policy, companies that have initiated it haven&amp;#8217;t found any problems. Contrary to this, they&amp;#8217;ve actually found that their staff tend to be more motivated towards work. Even though the staff can take as many vacation days as they choose, they still need to fulfill their work duties. It&amp;#8217;s this need to fulfill the work duties and keep everything operating smoothly that calls them back to the office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A policy like this puts emphasis more on accomplishments and not hours put in. Many of the hours that a staff member puts in when they don&amp;#8217;t feel motivated are actually wasted hours. By putting an emphasis on accomplishments, this pushes the staff members to focus on achieving goals and completing projects and not simply running down the clock. That said, these policies have been largely tested on staff members that have a high degree of accountability and control over their work, rather than entry-level positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether an unlimited vacation policy would work for your company is based on your company and staff&amp;#8217;s culture. If your staff are generally happy, motivated, and eager to get the job done then an unlimited vacation policy will probably increase productivity. It can also be used along with flex-time to offer a truly customized work experience. While unconventional, such a system allows trusted staff members to work when they know they will be the most effective, and take their hours and days when they know they feel unmotivated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a system does carry out unlimited vacation days, however, the company does need to have a firm system of monitoring whether projects are being completed the right way and by the deadlines. Otherwise there will be no way of judging the increased efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Overcoming Peer Pressure To Not Take Vacations</title>
   <link href="YOUR_URL/overcoming-peer-pressure-to-not-take-vacations"/>
   <updated>2013-02-26T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>BLOG_URL/overcoming-peer-pressure-to-not-take-vacations</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1 class=&#39;center&#39; id=&#39;overcoming_peer_pressure_to_not_take_vacations&#39;&gt;Overcoming peer pressure to not take vacations&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common problem that employees often face today with their time off is the inability to take a vacation without feeling guilty. This guilt can come from peer pressure, supervisors, or even themselves. Employees need to overcome this fear and take their vacations on the proper schedule without feeling as though they are doing something wrong. Every business knows that staff need their own time to rest, recover, and get ready for a productive year, which is why they track and watch these vacation days appropriately. On the company side of things, many employers need to watch how they treat vacations and consider whether they may add to an atmosphere that makes people nervous to take them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the schedule tracking software that your business provides may make it easier to take a vacation without a guilty conscience. You can pull up a calendar with your supervisor and track the projected attendance of your coworkers. By doing this, you can adjust your time off to correlate with an area on the calendar that attendance is high. Once you&amp;#8217;ve done this, you don&amp;#8217;t need to feel guilty or as though you&amp;#8217;re leaving the rest of your office short-staffed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s important for every staff member to recognize that their vacation days are not a gift but rather earned with the hours that they work. Vacation is as much a part of what a business owes their staff as their actual salary, and often extra vacation time is used instead of higher salaries. And even though other staff members may cringe when you talk about taking your vacation, they&amp;#8217;re often all too eager to take theirs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Businesses need to take care not to cultivate an atmosphere where people feel as though they&amp;#8217;re being discouraged from taking a vacation. This means not meeting requests for vacation time with reluctance. If the company is tracking their staff&amp;#8217;s vacations with the right software it should be a trivial matter for them to keep everyone on a good schedule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to ease vacations, businesses can start a transparent system whereby the staff can use areas of the tracking software themselves so that they can see on their own when the best days would be to take a vacation without upsetting anyone else. This will allow staff members to consider their plans without feeling awkward or guilty about it. It is far preferable to a company that staff members do their scheduling in advance, because otherwise they may wait until last-minute and make things difficult to adjust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While vacation is earned, most companies today do not let it accrue past a certain point. Some companies will allow you to cash out your vacation days, but many won&amp;#8217;t. This means that if you do not appropriately take your vacation days, you may lose it completely. If you truly feel that your fellow staff will be adversely affected by your vacation days, you should sit down with your supervisor and discuss it. There may be a solution that does not involve you missing out on the vacation that you have earned.&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>Creating The Best Time Off Tracking Software</title>
   <link href="YOUR_URL/best-time-off-tracking-software"/>
   <updated>2013-02-11T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>BLOG_URL/best-time-off-tracking-software</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1 class=&#39;center&#39; id=&#39;time_off_tracking_software&#39;&gt;Time off tracking software&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time off tracking software should be as easy to use and simple as possible. You shouldn&amp;#8217;t have to think about how to submit a time off request. It should be as simple as possible so that you can work on the tasks that need your attention. At Zarlu, I have designed in my opinion the best software for tracking employee time off requests. Each of your employees will receive a subscription to Zarlu when you sign up for an account, and they will be able to use our fully functional calendar, scheduler, and notification system to easily manage their work schedules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#39;easily_approve_time_off_requests&#39;&gt;Easily approve time off requests&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to developing easy to use software for employees, I focused on developing an intuitive software application for managers and human resources to easily manage employee time off requests. What good is a great employee system if managers and human resources can&amp;#8217;t manage time off requests efficiently? At Zarlu, I thought about what would be best for your account from inception to daily use. The first step was to create a way to setup your account and to group employees by the manager or human resources personnel responsible for approving an employee&amp;#8217;s schedule and calendar changes. To solve this Zarlu provides an easy drag and drop interface for you to enter and group up to 150 employees without having to even change pages! Zarlu&amp;#8217;s setup is incredibly easy. Simply add an employee, which only needs an email and temporary password, and then drag them underneath the employee who will approve or reject their time off requests. It&amp;#8217;s that simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#39;email_time_off_requests&#39;&gt;Email time off requests&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took simplifying submitting time off requests beyond what other time off tracking software offers by allowing any employee to submit a time off request without even signing into Zarlu. In fact, the staffer does not even have to have a web browser open. To send a time off request, simply send an email to timeoff@mail.zarlu.com with a subject in the MM/DD/YY or MM-DD-YY format and we will add time off request directly to the employee&amp;#8217;s calendar and notify the manager or human resources employee to approve or reject the request. The employee can also add a message in the email&amp;#8217;s message field to give an explanation for the request to the employee from your company who is tracking time off requests. No need to submit a time off request through a website and then send an email to a manager. We do both tasks at once whether you are logged into www.zarlu.com or sending an email from your phone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope I have given you a helpful walk through of our time off tracking features.

   <title>Zarlu Employee Calendar and Scheduler Goes Live</title>
   <link href="YOUR_URL/zarlu-employee-calendar-and-scheduler-goes-live"/>
   <updated>2013-02-06T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>BLOG_URL/zarlu-employee-calendar-and-scheduler-goes-live</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1 class=&#39;center&#39; id=&#39;zarlu_employee_time_off_tracking_software&#39;&gt;Zarlu Employee Time Off Tracking Software&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After months of hard work, I am proud to officially announce the release of Zarlu. I started working on Zarlu after experiencing the frustration of submitting time off requests using traditional employee scheduling software. I found their software to be clunky, dated, and hard to use. Submitting a time off request should be easy. Viewing my schedule for a month, week, or day should be easy. Having a calendar to view my schedule is a requirement for a great personnel scheduler. I decided I could design a web application that made taking time off a better experience for the employee and the business. I wanted something better then what currently exists!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Zarlu, I tried to make a scheduling application that I would want to use on a daily basis. My top three priorities were ease of use, speed, and convenience. For speed, Zarlu was developed using the latest web development techniques to allow pages and information to load as quickly as possible. The majority of Zarlu is rendered on our server &amp;lt; 100ms. Yes, you read that right. I measure your time in milliseconds because that&amp;#8217;s how much I care about devlivering excellent software. Sub 200ms response times are synonomous with &amp;#8220;instant&amp;#8221; in the software industry. With Zarlu, you will never have to wait around staring at a spinner or indefinite progress bar while your computer &amp;#8220;thinks&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my top three priorities for Zarlu, I also mentioned conveience. I have developed a feature that allows you to send a time off request directly from your email account whether on your phone at the top of a ski slope, on your iPad laying in bed while recovering from the flu, or on your notebook at work. No logging in required. Just email us at timeoff@mail.zarlu.com with your work email and we will add your time off request to your calendar and notify your manager to approve or reject your request. That&amp;#8217;s it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, ease of use was my third goal in my trifecta of priorites for developing calendar and scheduler software. I have developed our calendar to use a simple drag and drop interface to make modifying or adding events as simple as possible. Need to extend an event on your calendar? Simply click on it and drag your mouse to the desired time. Zarlu will save the event to your schedule when you let go of the mouse. How easy is that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I look forward to hearing your feedback of what Zarlu can do to make scheduling even easier for you! Click on the link below to try Zarlu for yourself if you haven&amp;#8217;t already. Our lowest plan is free to use with no time limit!&lt;/p&gt;</content>

   <title>How Does Zarlu Secure My Data?</title>
   <link href="YOUR_URL/how-does-zarlu-keep-my-data-safe"/>
   <updated>2013-02-06T00:00:00-07:00</updated>
   <id>BLOG_URL/how-does-zarlu-keep-my-data-safe</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1 class=&#39;center&#39; id=&#39;how_does_zarlu_secure_my_data&#39;&gt;How does Zarlu secure my data?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the past few years there has been a movement to move data from local computers into the cloud. Cloud Storage provides many benefits: it can be accessed from multiple devices, your data can stay synced between machines, and cloud providers are a backup for your data. One downside to cloud applications is that the user is giving up control of their data and trusting a 3rd party vendor to keep their data safe. As a cloud web application, I designed Zarlu to be worthy of your trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#39;ssl&#39;&gt;SSL&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look in the url of your web browser. Do you the prefix https:// instead of http://? Zarlu uses SSL on every page of our application to ensure that your activity on Zarlu is encrypted. This is the same encryption used by banks for their web pages. Zarlu uses a 256 bit encryption algorithm to encrypt your data when we send it to you. Many browsers represent this connection with a padlock icon to notify you that your connection is secure. Many websites do not encrypt even their log in form, which means that if you log on to their software from a public place (Starbucks, airport, etc) a hacker can steal your username and password. By using SSL for our forms, we protect you from this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#39;payment_information&#39;&gt;Payment Information&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you decide to use one our wonderful paid plans, Zarlu asks you for your credit card so that we can charge you for the plan you selected. When you fill out the credit card form and hit submit, your credit card information goes directly to our payment provider &lt;a href=&#39;http://www.stripe.com&#39; target=&#39;_blank&#39;&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt;. Stripe handles all your payment information and then lets us know that your account has been paid for. We then store your last 4 digits of your credit card only so that we can show you which credit card of yours Stipe has on file in case you wish to change cards for a future payment. Your credit card number, security code, expiration month, and expiration year never even touch our servers. We send this information directly to Stripe using the https protocol that encrypts your information when we send it to Stripe. Https is the same protocol used by banks. We don&amp;#8217;t even log your credit card info. Zarlu does this because Stripe handles payment security at the most stringent level possible. They are certified as a PCI Service Provider Level 1 the highest level possible and are used by thousands of applications for their commitment to security. By using Stripe, Zarlu is also PCI compliant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#39;password&#39;&gt;Password&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have you heard of all the recent high profile security breaches where users passwords have been stolen? Many websites store your password simply as plain text, which means in their data if your password is 123456 then their data says your password is 123456. Software can never be perfect, so to protect this we encrypt your password. So if there is ever a security breach on Zarlu, when the attacker looks at your password they will see something like fdlksjfferr98weurwiewf instead of 123456. You many have noticed that our login forms say pass phrase instead of password. We want to encourage you to use a phrase or even a sentence instead of a single word. It is much harder for someone to guess &amp;#8220;My son&amp;#8217;s name is John, and I love going hiking with him!&amp;#8221; then &amp;#8220;password1&amp;#8221;. Keep that trick in mind for other passwords as well!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#39;software&#39;&gt;Software&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zarlu uses several programming languages and frameworks to give you the best scheduling experience. I check for any updates, bug fixes, or patches on a daily basis to ensure that our software is secure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#39;data_backups&#39;&gt;Data Backups&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on your plan level, we either backup your data on a weekly or daily basis. If something goes wrong on our end (server failure, etc), we have a copy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this page has given you a better understanding of how much we value the security of your information here at Zarlu. If you have any additional concerns feel free to contact us by clicking on the support link. If you have detected any security vulnerability in the Zarlu software, please click on support and let us know! Good deeds are rewarded!&lt;/p&gt;</content>
