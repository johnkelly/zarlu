      <p>Every employee subscription comes with a fully featured calendar. Each calendar can be viewed as the whole month, week, or a single day. Schedule for multiple days or as little as 15 minutes. Drag and Drop events as your schedule changes. Increase the event's time by simpling dragging the event. To create a new calendar event simply click on a day, hour, or minute and drag your mouse/finger to the end time. It's that easy!</p>

      <h4>Scheduler Setup in 1-2</h4>
      <p>
      Jumping into a new software application usually means dealing with a painful data import process. Zarlu has streamlined the employee import process to be as efficient and quick as posssible. Simply enter an employee's work email and a pass phrase they can change later.  That's it! No confirmation emails or long sign up process.  The employee is then ready to start using Zarlu!  Grouping employees by manager to approve their schedule can be done on the same page by simply clicking on the employee and dragging their email under the manager's email. With those two steps your account is completely setup!
