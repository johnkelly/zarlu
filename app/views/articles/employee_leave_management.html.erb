    <h1 class="center">Employee Leave Management</h1>
    <p>
    Many businesses offer their employees work leave as a valuable company benefit. Without question, employees likewise consider "time off" as their most treasured fringe benefit. Employers offer their employees work leave in many forms depending on a company's sector, location, and culture. Because of the variances in paid leave policies within companies, it is a difficult process to manage employee leave efficiently.
    </p>
    <p>
    Many companies choose to manage employee leave using hard copy charts or using table software such as Microsoft Excel. Both of these processes have significant issues that make them suboptimal choices for managing employee leave.
    </p>
    <p>
    The use of physical paper instead of a software program has several issues. A paper chart can easily be misplaced, lost in pile of papers, or accidentally discarded in the trash. A "back-up" copy of the chart could theoretically be made to eliminate this issue, but it would require a copy of the employee leave chart to be made every time a change is made in the original. Going to the copier to make a copy every time a change is made is both time consuming and error prone. Further, editing mistakes in employee leave paperwork leads ultimately to an illegible mess of cross outs, scribbles, and white outs.
    </p>
    <p>
    Using paper to track employee leave is an extremely inefficient process. This has led to the adoption of spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel to manage employee leave requests. Unfortunately, this process is also riddled with inefficiencies making spreadsheet software also a poor choice for businesses in the digital age.
    </p>
    <p>
    Spreadsheet software was not designed with managing employee leave in mind. Solutions such as Excel were designed to be general purpose software solutions for a variety of tasks. With buttons for features having nothing to do with managing employee leave and tracking employee attendance, the use of general purpose spreadsheet invites confusion for even the most technically inclined.
    </p>
    <p>
    In addition, spreadsheet software has many of the same faults as the "paper solution". With spreadsheet software, employee attendance can only be managed from a single machine. In the era of smart phones, tablets, and the "Cloud", this model is both obsolete and inefficient. A desktop spreadsheet program and its data are still a single point of potential failure, just like a hard copy piece of paper. If the computer that your employee attendance data is stored on has a hard drive failure, is stolen, or is misplaced, so too all of the attendance data is lost, and co-workers may lose their jobs.
    </p>
    <p>
    The best way to manage employee leave is to use a Cloud subscription service to minimize a company’s exposure to the risky single point of failure problems that plague spreadsheet and paper attendance management. Cloud subscription services, such as Zarlu, provide a secure web-based employee leave solution that eliminates inefficiencies. One huge advantage to a Cloud service is that it gives businesses the peace of mind that their data is completely secure and safe. Zarlu gives a secure experience by using the https protocol (the padlock you see on bank websites) on every single page to ensure that employee business data is secure.
    </p>
    <p>
    When you visit your webpage on Zarlu, your connection is encrypted ensuring that your data is sent directly from Zarlu to your device without the possibility of a hacker intercepting your unencrypted information. With security taken care of, Zarlu also backups up your data daily ensuring that in the unlikely event that our servers fail your data can easily be restored on a moment’s notice. In contrast to spreadsheet and paper solutions, web-based employee leave software provides a clearly superior security and data safety value for a business.
    </p>
    <p>
    But why stop at safety and security? Remember how long it took to learn and use a spreadsheet program? Clicking on all those buttons and hidden menus? Zarlu eliminates all that needless complexity.  Zarlu is built specifically to manage employee leave requests. The employee leave management process has been streamlined to be as easy as possible. Every page has less than 7 buttons with no hidden menus.
    </p>
    <p>
    How can Zarlu possibly offer more value than a spreadsheet program with thousands of buttons? Zarlu’s engineers designed the software precisely with customer satisfaction in mind. The fact is that a thousand useless buttons provide more harm than good. Not only does a business have to pay to train employees to learn how to use a complicated spreadsheet program, but tasks such as filling out a time-off request or viewing an employee’s attendance record take longer for employees and managers to complete. Save your employees' time and your managers' time by switching to Zarlu.
    </p>
    <p>
    Zarlu’s engineers know that your company’s time is valuable and as a result, your complete satisfaction is our number one objective. Every page of Zarlu has a short one minute tour that can be accessed at any time to teach a manager or employee how to navigate Zarlu within minutes. No day long seminars required! No need to worry about retraining employees to use Zarlu because no training is needed! Our short one minute tours can be accessed at any time and our software is so intuitive that the entire Zarlu attendance software can be learned in less than ten minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
    Best of all, as a web-based employee management solution, employee leave can be managed from anywhere on any web- enabled device. Send a sick leave request from your doctor’s office, approve an employee leave request while walking to a meeting, or send a vacation leave request from the airport! With all the benefits of web-based business leave software, it's time to create an account!
