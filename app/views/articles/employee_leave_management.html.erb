  <h1 class="center">Employee Leave Management</h1>
  <p>
  Many businesses offer their employees leave from work as a benefit for choosing to work for their company. Employee leave is offered in several different forms depending on the company's sector, location, and culture. Because of the variance in paid leave policies between companies, it can be a difficult task to find a process to manage employee leave efficiently.
  </p>
  <p>
  Many companies choose to manage employee leave using hard copy charts or using table software such as Microsoft Excel. Both of these processes have significant issues that make them suboptimal choices for managing employee leave.
  </p>

  Using physical paper instead of a software program has several issues. A paper chart can be easily misplaced or lost in pile of papers or accidentally discarded into the trash. A copy of the chart could be made to avoid this issue, but it would require a copy of the employee leave chart to be made every time a change is made to the original. Going to the copier to make a copy every time a change is made is time consuming and error prone. Editing mistakes on the employee leave paperwork can also easily turn the page into an illegible mess of cross outs, scribbles, and white out.

  Many business have moved away from paper due to the reasons listed above and many more inefficiencies of using paper to track employee leave. This has led to the adoption of using spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel to manage employee leave and attendance. Unfortunately, this process is also riddled with inefficiencies that make using spreadsheet software also a poor choice for businesses in the digital age.
  </p>
  <p>
  Spreadsheet software was not designed with managing employee leave in mind. Solutions such as Excel were designed to be general purpose software solutions for a variety of tasks. With buttons for features having nothing to do with managing employee leave or attendance, using general purpose spreadsheet software can be a challenging and confusing task for even the most technically inclined.
  </p>
  <p>
  In addition, spreadsheet software has many of the same faults that the paper process introduced. With spreadsheet software, employee attendance can only be managed from a single machine. In the era of smart phones, tablets, and the internet, this model is dated and inefficient. A desktop spreadsheet program and its data can also still be a single point of failure just like a hard copy piece of paper. If the computer that your attendance data is stored on has hard drive failure, is stolen, or is misplaced all your attendance data is lost and a co-worker may lose their job.

  <p>
  The best way to manage employee leave is to using a cloud subscription service to minimize a company’s exposure to the risky single point of failure problems that plague spreadsheet and paper attendance management. Cloud subscription services, such as Zarlu, provide a secure web based employee leave solution that eliminates inefficiencies. One huge advantage to a cloud service is that it gives business the piece of mind that their data is safe. Zarlu gives a secure experience by using the https protocol (the padlock you see on bank websites) on every single page to ensure that a businesses’ data is secure.

  When you visit  a webpage on Zarlu, your connection is encrypted ensuring that your data is sent directly from Zarlu to your device without the possibility of a hacker intercepting your unencrypted information. With security taken care of, Zarlu also backups up your data daily ensuring that in the unlikely event that our servers fail your data can easily be restored on a moment’s notice. Contrasting with the spreadsheet and paper attendance solutions, web based employee leave software solution provides a far superior security and data safety value for a business.

  But why stop at safety and security? Remember how long it took to learn and use a spreadsheet program? Clicking on all those button and hidden menus? Zarlu eliminates all the confusion. Zarlu is built specifically for managing employee leave and attendance. The employee leave management process has been streamlined to be as easy as possible. Every page have less than 5 buttons with no hidden menus.

  How can Zarlu possibly offer more value than a spreadsheet program with thousands of buttons? Zarlu’s engineers designed the software with customer happiness in mind. The fact is that a thousand useless buttons provide more harm than good. Not only does a business have to pay to train employees to learn how to use a complicated spreadsheet program, but tasks such as filling out a time off request or viewing an employee’s attendance record take longer for employees and managers to execute which wastes their time and your business’ time.
