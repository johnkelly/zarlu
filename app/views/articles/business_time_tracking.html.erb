    <p>
    Zarlu provides our customers with the ability to easily track business attendance. Tracking employee attendance can be daunting task to Human Resource (HR) departments or managers if they are using a paper or spreadsheet attendance system.
    </p>
    <p>
    In a spreadsheet attendance system, a manager or HR personnel must manually manipulate the spreadsheet rows and columns, use complex spreadsheet formulas, and master the thousands of buttons that spreadsheet software provides. In addition, a manager or HR must view the data in hard to read columns and rows that increase the probability of accidental errors. Managers or HR personnel must then manually manipulate the raw attendance data and convert it into understandable, readable information that can finally be used to understand their employees' attendance. This process can take hours or even days.
    </p>
    <p>
    Zarlu provides an automated way for managers and HR to easily track and view employee attendance. Zarlu offers each employee a calendar to view their schedule and an activity feed that has three different views showcasing how your employees and managers are using Zarlu. With realtime calculations and data, the benefits over traditional spreadsheet software are instantaneous.
    </p>
    <p>
    The calendar provides managers with a detailed insight into when their employees are scheduling leave. The calendar color codes events on the calendar by type of leave: vacation, sick, personal, holiday, unpaid, or other. By color coding the events by category, Zarlu allows managers to track employee attendance by category from a monthly, weekly, or daily view for each employee they manage.
    </p>
    <p>
    As mentioned earlier, Zarlu also provides each account with an activity feed with several views that track all attendance changes and employee activity. The first and default schedule tracking view is “My Activity”. The My Activity view gives an employee the ability to track and view how they are using Zarlu. The activity feed features a complete history of the employee’s activity on Zarlu. Each event in the activity feed has a date time stamp and a description of the activity. Zarlu tracks schedule changes, time off request rejections, time off request approvals, and several other important events. With access to their activity, an employee can easily view and track their attendance changes as far back as their account creation.
    </p>
    <p>
    The second view, which is only accessible to managers, provides a list of all schedule changes for employees that a manager is supervising. A manager can easily know whether there is a time off request that needs to be reviewed or view how their employees are using Zarlu.  Each activity also includes a picture of the employee (if provided) that can help managers if they are bad with names, have large number of employees, or have multiple employees with the same name.
    </p>
    <p>
    The third schedule tracking view is the company activity feed. This feed gives an overview of every activity that has happened in your account since it was created. At Zarlu, we strive to make your data as transparent as possible to give you as much insight into employee schedules as possible. The company feed can provide insight into when employees are submitting time off, how quickly schedules are being reviewed, and notify you when new employees have been successfully added to Zarlu.
    </p>
    <p>
    In addition to the activity feeds, Zarlu provides managers with the ability to track employee time off by specific categories for a given year. The employee page lists all your company's employees and specifies how many vacation, sick, holiday, personal, or unpaid time an employee has used. With this view, it is easy to track employees who may be abusing your company’s attendance policy.
    </p>
    <p>
    With all the above schedule tracking features, Zarlu provides an incredible web based experience for small or large businesses. As a web based attendance program, Zarlu also provides customers with software updates that add additional functionality to Zarlu at no additional charge. Without giving too much away, Zarlu has several new analytical tools set to release in the near future, which will radically change the time tracking industry.
